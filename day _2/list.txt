# lists
* lists is used to store multiple items in a single variable.

* lists is a built in datatype in python used to store collections of data.
there are four built in datatype that store collections of data lists, 
tuple, set function.

* lists are created using squire brackets.
ex: lists = ["cat", "dog", "monkey"]

* lists items are ordered changeable and allows duplicate value. ordered 
means if we add item to a lists that items placed at the end of the lists.
changeable means we can add or remove items in the list. a list can have 
multiple same items means allows duplicate value.

* lists length : with len() function we can determine how many items a 
list has 
ex: len(lists)

* type() : we can determine what is the data type to used with help of 
type() function.
ex: type(lists)

* access : we can access a list by referring to the index number, range
of indexes, negative indexing and range of negative indexing

ex: lists[2], lists[-1], list[2:3], lists[-4,-1]

* in keyword : to determine a specific item is present in lists.

ex: 
if "cat" in lists: 
print("yes")
else: 
print("no")

* Change item value: we can change specific value refer to the index 
and range of indexes: 

ex: 
lists[2] = "lion"
lists[1:3] = ["deer", "monkey"]

*insert(): the insert() method add new item at the specific index without 
replace any item.
lists.insert(3,"duck")

*append(): to add an item to the end of the list.
ex: 
lists.append("snake")

*extend(): to append elements from another list to the current lists.

* remove lists items : remove(), pop(), clear() are used to remove lists
items.



# tuple

*tuple: tuple items are ordered unchangeable and allows duplicate values.

* access: we can access a tuple to refer to the number of index, range of 
indexes and negative indexing and range of negative indexing.

* update tuple: Tuples are unchangeable, or immutable as it also is called.
But there is a workaround. You can convert the tuple into a list, 
change the list, and convert the list back into a tuple
