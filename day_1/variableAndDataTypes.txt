variable: 
variables are containers for storing data values.
python has no command for declaring a variable.

1. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
2. A variable name cannot start with a number
3. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and 
underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three 
different variables)
5. A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.


Python data types: 

Python Data types are the classification or categorization of data 
items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can 
be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in 
Python programming, Python data types are classes and variables are 
instances (objects) of these classes. The following are the standard or
built-in data types in Python:

1. Numeric – int, float, complex
2. Sequence Type – string, list, tuple
3. Mapping Type – dict
4. Boolean – bool
5. Set Type – set, frozenset
6. Binary Types – bytes, bytearray, memoryview
